Environment:
* Python 3.6
* Dependencies are present in the file requirements.txt. In order to install the dependencies, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* It is strongly suggested that the code be run on a system with Nvidia GPU support, as otherwise POS tag generation and tensorflow make take a long time to run
* _Note: Tensorflow-GPU requires CUDA and preferably cuDNN support to run effectively. These libraries need to be installed separately if not already present on the system. Alternatively, one can install the CPU version of tensorflow._
